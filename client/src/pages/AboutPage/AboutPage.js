            <p>
                Movie-Books is a platform dedicated to exploring the fascinating connections
                between literature and film.

                Have you ever spotted a character reading a specific book in a movie and
                wondered about its significance? Or noticed thematic parallels between a
                film's plot and a classic novel? Movie-Books aims to be the definitive
                resource for documenting these instances.
            </p>
            <p>
                Users can create "connections" linking a movie and a book, providing
                context, insights, screenshots, and links to the relevant works. Engage
                with the community by commenting on connections, liking your favorites,
                and discovering new literary links in cinema.

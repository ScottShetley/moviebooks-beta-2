        <h2>‚ú® Latest Progress - Edit Connection & User Following Core Implemented!</h2>
        <p>Significant milestones achieved, adding core features and interactivity:</p>
        <ul>
            {/* Edit Connection Details */}
            <li>
                <strong>Edit Your Connections:</strong> Authors can now access an "Edit" link on their connection's detail page. You can modify context, tags, book author, and replace the screenshot. Access is restricted to the original author. This completes the core CRUD for connections.
            </li>
            {/* User Following Details */}
            <li>
                <strong>User Following Core:</strong> The fundamental backend logic, database models, API routes, and initial frontend components for user following are now implemented and functional. Users can follow/unfollow others via the backend and notifications are generated for new followers.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These additions bring important editing capabilities and lay the groundwork for social interactions like following!</p>

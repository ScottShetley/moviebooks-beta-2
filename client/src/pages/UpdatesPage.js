        <h3 className={styles.subHeading}>Feed Revamp & Fixes (Previous Major Update)</h3>
        <p>The main feed just got a significant upgrade and several usability fixes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Text-Only Posts:</strong> You can now create connections with just context text, without needing to select a movie or book. Perfect for quick thoughts or general discussion!</li>
            <li><strong>Collapsible Cards:</strong> Standard connection cards (with movie/book) now appear collapsed by default on the feed, saving space. Click to expand and see the full details!</li>
            <li><strong>Text Post Deletion:</strong> Added the ability for users to delete their own text-only posts.</li>
            <li><strong>Consistent Card Layout:</strong> Ensured both standard and text-only cards have the same width for a cleaner look.</li>
            <li><strong>Placeholder Hiding:</strong> Removed the "No Screenshot Available" placeholder on standard cards when no context image is uploaded.</li>
            <li><strong>Share Button Fixes:</strong> The enhanced share pop-up now works correctly on text-only posts, and the visual layout is fixed on standard posts.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobile Layout Improvements:</strong> Adjusted the action button layout on standard cards for better usability on smaller screens.</li>
        </ul>

              <li>

                <strong>Improved Build & Runtime Stability:</strong> Resolved various deployment errors, ensuring the build process completes correctly and the application runs reliably on Render.

             <li>

                <strong>Uptime Monitoring Configured:</strong> Updated UptimeRobot to monitor the correct production URL, confirming the site is accessible and helping prevent the Render free tier service from spinning down due to inactivity.

             <li>
                <strong>Profile Privacy Toggle:</strong> Added a "Make Profile Private" option on the Edit Profile page. You can now control the visibility of your profile and connections.

             </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Public Users List (`/all-users`):</strong> Implemented a page listing all users with public profiles. Ensured all existing users are included in this list by default (set to public unless they change the setting).

           <p>Significant milestones achieved, adding core features and interactivity:</p>
           <ul>
             {/* Edit Connection Details */}
             <li>
                 <strong>Edit Your Connections:</strong> Authors can now access an "Edit" link on their connection's detail page. You can modify context, tags, book author, and replace the screenshot. Access is restricted to the original author. This completes the core CRUD for connections.
             </li>
             {/* User Following Details */}
             <li>
                 <strong>User Following Core:</strong> The fundamental backend logic, database models, API routes, and initial frontend components for user following are now implemented and functional. Users can follow/unfollow others via the backend and notifications are generated for new followers.
             </li>
         </ul>
         <p>These additions bring important editing capabilities and lay the groundwork for social interactions like following!</p>
